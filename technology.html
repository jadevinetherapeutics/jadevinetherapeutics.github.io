            <h2>AI-Based Structural Design</h2>
            <p>We utilize state-of-the-art generative and discriminative modeling techniques to design novel therapeutic agents. Our AI-based approach, which includes reinforcement learning, enables us to rapidly identify and optimize potential drug candidates, ensuring high efficacy and safety.</p>
            <h2>Rational ML-Guided Design</h2>
            <p>Through advanced structural prediction, we enable rational ML-guided design of therapeutic agents. By leveraging machine learning and reinforcement learning, we can explore a vast chemical space and identify promising candidates with optimal properties. Our methodologies allow us to predict the structure and function of proteins with high accuracy, facilitating the development of targeted therapies.</p>
            <h2>Intersection of Target Discovery and ML Capabilities</h2>
            <p>At Jadevine Therapeutics, we find the intersection of our target discovery capabilities and our ML capabilities to be a key driver of innovation. Our integrated approach combines the power of structural biology, machine learning, and reinforcement learning to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of effective treatments.</p>
